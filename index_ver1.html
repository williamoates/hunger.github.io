        <p class="intro">Existing data analytics & AI firm Winnow Solutions has recruited our team to explore a new business market opportunity.  Winnow currently works with restaurants using analytics and AI to improve efficiency and reduce food waste.  However, while the software is highly effective, some food waste is still a reality for many institutions.</p>
        <p>The CEO of Winnow has asked our team to identify the three key zip codes, in the United States, to determine where they could roll out a new component of their software package. This software will allow for real time distribution of excess (waste) food from institutions, such as restaurants, which could be transferred to places of need such as food banks or homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>They have requested mapping visuals to isolate the top three zip codes where food excess and hunger are both highly prevalent.  They have also asked that we generate a prototype website which could, in real time, be used to locate within each zip code participants with excess food for those who are in need.</p>
